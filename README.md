# Manticore Search course code demos
===================

This repository contains the source code used in several courses at https://play.manticoresearch.com/.

- Search query autocomplete - https://play.manticoresearch.com/simpleautocomplete/
- Search results highlighting - https://play.manticoresearch.com/highlighting/
- Search query autocorrect - https://play.manticoresearch.com/didyoumean/
- More like this search result - https://play.manticoresearch.com/mlt/
- Faceted search - https://play.manticoresearch.com/faceting/

Autocomplete, Autocorrect and Faceted search samples use a small movies data collection (https://data.world/data-society/imdb-5000-movie-dataset).
To create the index check the course about importing CSV files - https://play.manticoresearch.com/csv/.

MLT (more like this) uses a news collection from https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news.
